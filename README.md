- In the .env put it as "DATABASE_URL=your.database.url.HERE"

13. Now its linked to your project make sure to run the command to migrate all the models into your database as it is currently empty.

- Make migrations if you made any recent changes to the database models.

python manage.py makemigrations

- Migrate to move all the changes into your database.

python manage.py migrate

- There are more and other varriatons with diffrent useses [Click here to learn more (Django 5.0)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/migrations/)

14. Now that migration is completed you are all set.
15. If you recieved an error please sort this out and then try again.

### Deployment

Used Heroku to deploy the website. You can [Visit Live Site by clicking here](https://blossom-haven-ci-pp5-d8c652557fbc.herokuapp.com/)

#### How to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/):

1. **Run Migrations:** Once your project is deployed, you'll need to run any pending database migrations. You can do this using Heroku's web-based console or by running commands in your local terminal.
2. **Create a Superuser:** If your project uses Django's admin interface, you may want to create a superuser account on Heroku. You can do this by accessing your app's shell through the Heroku dashboard and running the createsuperuser command.
3. **Create a Heroku Account:** If you haven't already, sign up for a Heroku account at heroku.com.
4. **Prepare Your Django Project:** Ensure your Django project is properly configured for deployment. This includes setting up a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies and a Procfile specifying the command to start your application.
5. **Install Gunicorn:** Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server for Python. You'll need to install it via pip: "pip install gunicorn"
6. **Create a Procfile:** In the root directory of your project, create a file named Procfile (without any file extension) and add the following line: web: "web: gunicorn burger_blast.wsgi:application"
7. **Update Django Settings:** Ensure your Django settings.py file is configured to work in a production environment. This includes setting DEBUG = False and adding Heroku's domain to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
8. **Create a requirements.txt File:** Generate a requirements.txt file listing all Python dependencies your project needs. You can create it by running: "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
9. **Create a Heroku App:** Go to the Heroku dashboard and create a new app. Choose a unique name for your app.
10. **Link GitHub Repo:** Under deploy tab in the settings link your GitHub repository.
11. **Set Up Environment Variables:** Now under settings tab set any necessary environment variables for this django project. See chart below for needed key and values.

**Images**

- All images use on the website are made by [fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus?tab=readme-ov-file) which at time of writting this is a completely free AI image generator that uses your own hardware to generate images.

**More Credits**

- My wife who’s been super supportive of this change in career for me and just being out right amazing we will get her into this one way or another I am sure.

- Code Institute for providing an excellent accelerated learning platform worth every penny.

- Botique Ado walk through from code instiute as this was the basis of the project. I originally was going to expand on that but I had a spur of the moment idea for a floarist site and I think I have nailed my version of a MVP and even tweaked it some more.

- My farmers market food stall [Bokit'la](https://www.bokitla.com/) they helped insprie the project unknowingly as I told them I had this project coming up and I will possibly be helping them soon impliment shopify to their website. As a side project I want to remake their site in Django and they said do it and send it so next up is theirs. I would have done it for this but they are specifically looking for shoppify and thats possibly out side the grading for this. They got my brain thinking of ideas and Blossom Haven came out of the wood works from that.
